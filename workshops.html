          <p class="mb-2">Need a "lifeline" on a project? Graduated from a bootcamp but still stuck on some material?  
            Working on The Next Big Thing, and you've got a bug you just can't solve?
            Or perhaps you're just feeling a bit discouraged and could use some friendly help?  
            I'm available as your "professional lifeline" for sessions that can last until we solve your problem, or up to 90 minutes,
            whichever comes first. 
            (We might code together, but official coding services are not included)
          </p>
          <p>Simply email me a brief description of your question, topic, or problem. I'll let you know if an office hours session would be appropriate.</p>

          <p class="mb-2">Tried a bootcamp or self-learning from videos, but missing the key "Aha!" moments that others seem to have?
              You'll need to have some prior exposure to Rails and understand
              basic Ruby syntax before you can take this workshop. But these beginner-focused sessions start from the beginning. 
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">This workshop is a 4-day psychedelic trip through a wormhole, condensing a typical 10-week program into 4 days.
              It's all possible because we focus on the parts that beginners have the most issues with,
            using a combination of live coding and self-paced challenges. 
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">You'll achieve the insights you need to finally make progress and brighten up your journey.</p>
          <p>The exact syllabus is customized for each group (typically 2-4 people) but generally topics include
            understanding functions in Ruby, what objects really are, what Rails routing is all about, 
            undestanding the entire HTTP request-response cycle,
            how to think about controllers, and demystifying models and the database layer.

          <p class="mb-2">Learning React is popular due to all to the job postings that seem to require it, 
            but trying to learn solely from books or videos can leave you feeling like you don't quite "get it."
              You'll need to have some prior experience with HTML and CSS 
              before you can take this workshop. But these beginner-focused sessions start from the beginning with 
              pure JavaScript. 
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">This workshop is a 3-day intensive in which we start with nothing but plain JavaScript 
            and slowly morph our code into full React apps.  
            By avoiding any "magic", you'll see the strengths AND weaknesses of the React paradigm,
             making it clear why other frameworks (like Next.js, etc.) exist at all.  We meet once a week, with
             a small challenge assigned as homework between sessions.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">We do NOT cover anything beyond React itself.  This is intentional because React is hard,
            and every core concept should be crystal-clear before folks learn anything else.
