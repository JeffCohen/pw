          <p class="mb-2">Tried a bootcamp or self-learning from videos, but missing that key "Aha!" moment?  These
            beginner-focused sessions start from the very beginning and put you through a 4-day wormhole to help
            you get insight you truly need to make progress on your own after the workshop.
          </p>
          <p>Topics are customized for each group (typically 2-4 people) but generally cover topics like
            understanding functions in Ruby, what objects really are, what Rails routing is all about, 
            how to think about controllers, and demystifying the model and database layer.
